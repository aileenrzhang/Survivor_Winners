### Installing

APK file is located at [survivor-winners.md](../survivorwinners/releases/latest-survivorwinners.apk)

This can be downloaded on any Android device so long as it meets the prerequisites stated above. If the app does not install right away, try bypassing download restrictions to allow downloading from unknown sources.

This may be under:
* Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Install unknown apps

* Settings > Security

You may need to give access to a specific app (e.g. the one with which you use to download the APK file). You may also see "Install Unknown Apps" or "Unknown sources"

If the app does not open, browse through your device with a file manager.



To run on a PC device, you can use an Android emulator, such as [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/). After installing the emulator, go into the My Apps tab and choose Install apk from the corner of the window.
